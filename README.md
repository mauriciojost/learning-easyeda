This are my notes about the use of [easyeda](https://easyeda.com).

## Main links

- [Components starred](https://easyeda.com/account/user/components/stared)

- [Schematic libraries](https://easyeda.com/components?docType=schematic)
- [PCB / package libraries](https://easyeda.com/components?docType=package)

## Look for favorite parts

In the schematics, press Shift+f and choose between
- SCH libs (for schematics)
  - Then `personal`
    - Then `favorite`
      - Then `all`
- PCB libs (for PCB)
